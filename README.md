# OffsetFinder
A sh script that finds offsets for you from an IPSW link :)
This can also generate offsets for betas.

## Use

```
./run.sh [IPSW URL]
```
You can run the script without any argument but it will ask you for the IPSW URL in the process.
## Dependencies
- [libpatchfinder](https://github.com/tihmstar/libpatchfinder) from [tihmstar](https://github.com/tihmstar) installed but MakeFile have to be configured with this command : 
```./configure --with-offsetexporter```

If you have trouble installing libpatchfinder or just want it installed for you, try running my [libpatchfinder installer script](https://github.com/c22dev/OffsetFinder/blob/main/lpfinstaller.sh).
- [partialZipBrowser](https://github.com/tihmstar/partialZipBrowser) installed to PATH (aka pzb)
- [Python 3](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/python@3.11) and [PyIMG4](https://github.com/m1stadev/PyIMG4) installed (```brew install python && pip3 install pyimg4```)
- An IPSW (iOS/iPadOS 16.0->16.6b1) URL (it can be obtained from [ipsw.me](https://ipsw.me/) or [ipswbeta.dev](https://ipswbeta.dev/))
- An Internet Connection

Note : 
This was only tested on macOS Sonoma ; you may not be able to run this script on Linux or older versions of macOS (like really old, Ventura, Monterey and Big Sur should run it fine)

## Offsets
Some offsets (based off thimstar’s template, which is the issue) are wrong. You need to change a few manually. 
These are the wrong ones:
```
._vm_map__hdr__links__prev
._vm_map__hdr__links__next
._vm_map__hdr__links__start
._vm_map__hdr__links__end
```
It should be + 0x10 instead of + 0x8. 

I won’t generate all offsets again but some little patching can be done easily.

I'm planning to add even more beta offsets in the upcomming days !
If you want to help me, try running the script and create a PR.

The offsets names are in this format `iDevice-Identifier iOS-Version iOS-Build-ID.h` e.g. `iPhone11,8 16.3 20D47.h`
